# Athena

- Athena is a serverless SQL based query service used to analyze data stored in S3
- Athena is built on the Presto engine
- Supports several formats:
    - CSV
    - JSON
    - ORC
    - Avro
    - Parquet
- Costs $5 per TB of data scanned
- Integrated with Amazon Quicksight
- Can be used to analyze logs and for data lakes
- Use columnar data type for cost savings:
    - Parquet or ORC are recommended formats
    - Glue can convert data to Parquet
- Compress data for smaller retrievals
- Partitioning datasets helps improve querying in Athena
- Using bigger files (> 128 MB recommended) improves scan performance
- *Federated Queries* allow queries to run on custom data sources
- Federated Queries connect to data sources using a special Lambda function called a *Data Source Connector*
