# Elastic Load Balancer

- Elastic Load Balancer is a service to optimize distributed routing of network traffic
- High availability means to replicate data across more that 1 availability zone
- Vertical Scaling means to provision larger instances
- Horizontal Scaling means to provision more instances
- Load Balancers route traffic to multiple downstream instances
- Elastic Load Balancers can:
  - Expose a single DNS endpoint for multiple servers
  - Perform health checks
  - Provide HTTPS and SSL/TLS
  - Enforce stickiness with cookies
  - Spread traffic across multiple Availability Zones
  - Separate public and private traffic
- ELB is an AWS managed service
- Health Checks require several things
  - port number
  - network protocol
  - endpoint (path)
  - timeout
  - Interval (frequency for sending health checks)
  - Healthy Threshold (number of health checks need to consider target healthy)
  - Unhealthy Threshold (number of health checks need to consider target unhealthy)
- AWS has four types of load balancers:

| Application Load Balancer | Network Load Balancer | Gateway Load Balancer |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Level | 7 Application Level | 4 Transport Level | 3 Network Level |
| Routs Traffic to | EC2, ECS, Lambda, IP address | TCP and UDP traffic | Private IP addresses |
| Ideal for | micro-services and containerization | Health Checks over TCP, HTTP, HTTPS | Firewalls and Payload Manipulation |
| Cross Zone Load Balancing | Enabled by Default | Disabled by Default | N/A |
| Notes | Supports stickiness using cookies | 1 static IP per AZ | Uses GENEVE protocol on port 6081 |

# Stickiness

- _Stickiness_ (AKA session affinity) is when an LB maps traffic from one client to one specific instance using cookies.
- Application based cookies:
  - Custom cookies:
    - Are generated by the target
    - Can include custom attributes as required by application
    - Cookie name must be specific for each target group
    - Can't use names [AWSALB, AWSALBAPP AWSALBTG]
  - Application cookies:
    - automatically generated by LB
    - Name is AWSALBAPP
- Duration based cookies
  - Generated by LB
  - Name is AWSALB
  - Expired based on a duration specified by LB

- Cross Zone Load Balancing distributes traffic evenly across all AZs
- If Cross Zone Load Balancing isn't used, the traffic is divided evenly among instances in AZ
- LBs come with a TLS cert, but users can upload their own certs
- Clients can us Server Name Indication (SNI) to specify the host name they reach
  - SNI a protocol which is used to load multiple certs onto one server so that the server can host multiple websites
  - SNI will require the client to indicate hostname of target server during TLS handshake
  - SNI will only work on ALB, NLB and CloudFront
- A Deregristration Delay will allow unhealthy instances to complete requests while it is being marked unhealthy without allowing new connections
- Targets can contain several health statuses
  - Initial (registered)
  - Healthy
  - Unhealthy
  - Unused (not registered)
  - Draining
  - Unavailable (health checks disabled)
- If an target group contains only unhealthy targets, it will distribute traffic across all targets
- LBs push metrics directly to CloudWatch

# Target Groups

- Target Groups are groups of resources to send ELB traffic to
- Target Groups have several settings:
  - Deregistration delay
  - Load Balancing (scheduling) algorithm:
    - Least outstanding requests
    - Round Robin
    - Flow Hash (based on hash of IP, protocol, port, TCP sequence number)
  - Slow start (send traffic gradually to EC2 instance to give time to start)
  - Stickiness (enabled or disabled)
  - Stickiness cookie name
  - Stickiness cookie duration
  - Listener Rules
- ALB Listeners have sequential rules with actions for a specific targets
- rule conditions include:
  - host-header
  - http-request-method (get, post)
  - ath-pattern
  - source-ip
  - http-header
  - query-string
- Target groups can be weighted in a rule
