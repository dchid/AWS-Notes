## Caching

- Cache is based on:

    - Session Cookies
    - Query String Parameters
- Can control *Time To Live TTL* using header
    - Between 0 seconds to 1 year
- Cache can be manually invalidated using CreateInvalidation API call
- There are options to forward all headers, a whitelist of headers, or default headers only
- Whitelists can be set in the Behavior settings
- The Origin Custom Headers setting sets a constant header value for all requests to origin
- Maximize cache hits by separating static and dynamic distributions
    - Dynamic distributions make calls REST APIs or HTTP servers
    - Static distributions make calls to static assets
- Forward cookies for session affinity from ALB to CloudFront to enable stickiness
